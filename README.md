Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse simplifies human-computer interaction using Hand Gestures and Voice Commands. No physical contact is needed â€” all I/O operations can be virtually controlled through gestures and voice.
The project uses Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques, combining MediaPipe Hand Detection with pybind11 for real-time gesture recognition, along with a custom Voice Assistant (Proton).
Works smoothly without any external hardware and is optimized for Windows platform.

Note: Use Python version: 3.8.5
